## 💡 Project Overview

Manual tracking of footwear sizes and production often leads to inefficiencies like stockouts or overproduction. Smart Step addresses this by linking **customer demand** directly to **manager decisions**, enabling timely production of the right sizes and improving customer satisfaction. This helps in planning production schedules more intelligently, minimizing delays, and maintaining balanced inventory levels.
